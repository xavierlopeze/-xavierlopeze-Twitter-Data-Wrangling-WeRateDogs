# Analyzing Data from Twitter User WeRateDogs [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)

In this project I am gathering information from the Twitter user WeRateDogs, this user posts images of cute dogs.
The data comes from different sources, in file format and also web-scrapped through the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api).
The goal is to assess, clean and analyze and produce insightful data visualizations as a result.

This project is part of the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) corresponding to the Data Wrangle project.


## Implementation
- Entire code is in Python 3.
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is used for interactive visualizations.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used for histograms.
